# Hi there, I'm Sam Soofy (@sam-soofy) 👋

Experienced full‑stack engineer with 7+ years of hands‑on experience designing and building secure, scalable systems.
I enjoy taking products from idea to production: APIs, data models, automation, infrastructure, and everything around them, with a background that spans crypto, marketplaces, automation tooling, and occasional blockchain integrations.

- 🧠 **Core:** Python · JavaScript/TypeScript · SQL/NoSQL
- 🏗️ **Backend:** FastAPI · Django REST · Express.js · NestJS · Next.js APIs
- 💾 **Data:** PostgreSQL · MongoDB · Redis · data pipelines & ETL
- 🔁 **Messaging & Realtime:** NATS.io · WebSockets · Socket.io
- 🧪 **Quality:** automated tests (Jest, Supertest, Playwright) · robust error handling
- 🐧 **Ops:** Docker · Linux · networking · CI/CD and deployment pipelines

I care about clean architecture, observability, security, and making systems easy to operate for teams that live with them every day.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **Multi‑stack Issue Tracker Series**  
  A study‑oriented project where I implement the same issue‑tracking product across multiple stacks to compare patterns and trade‑offs:
  - Full‑stack **Next.js** app
  - **NestJS** backend API
  - **FastAPI** backend API
  - **Django REST Framework** backend API
  - **Next.js** frontend‑only app
  - **React.js** SPA frontend

- **Production‑grade Backends**  
  Building and evolving APIs for marketplaces, crypto platforms, and plugin systems with authentication, observability, and strong security baselines.

- **Data & Analytics Track**  
  Deepening my skills in **data engineering and data science with Python** (Pandas, NumPy, statistics, notebooks, and data visualization), experimenting with **ML and AI agents**, and integrating those skills back into backend and analytics workflows.

## 💡 How I Think About Engineering

- **Product‑aware engineering:** I care about why we are building something as much as how.
- **Operational excellence:** logs, metrics, alerts, and runbooks are first‑class citizens.
- **Security & correctness:** validation, least privilege, and defense‑in‑depth by default.
- **Mentorship & collaboration:** I enjoy unblocking others and improving team practices.

I’m especially interested in the intersection of **backend systems, data engineering, and analytics**: building APIs and services that not only power products but also unlock better insights.
