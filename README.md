# Hi there, I'm Sam Soofy (@sam-soofy) :wave:

I am a **Semi-Senior Software Engineer and Back-end Developer**. Veteran Developer with 7+ years of hands-on and academic experience crafting secure, scalable web applications and automation tools that boost operational efficiency.

Expert in Python and JS/TS ecosystems, including FastAPI, Django, Express.js, NestJS, and Next.js, paired with relational (SQL/ ORMs) and non-relational (NoSQL/ODMs) databases. Proficient in CI/CD pipelines, web security protocols, Linux administration, networking, and scripting with Python/Bash to streamline full application lifecycles. With prior blockchain integrations enhancing data integrity, I'm now deepening skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, microservices, and advanced data engineering to architect high-performance solutions for dynamic teams. :rocket: :fire:
